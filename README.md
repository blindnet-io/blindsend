# Blindsend

Blindsend is an open source tool for private, end-to-end encrypted file exchange between two agents. It is zero trust, and only the agents that exhange files are able to read file content. Blindsend is still under development by [blindnet.io](https://blindnet.io/).

Blindsend conists of two parts:
1. [Back-end](https://github.com/blindnet-io/blindsend-be), which provides a REST API for managing file exchange workflows
2. [Front-end](https://github.com/blindnet-io/blindsend-fe), which handles encryption and decryption of files on agents' local machines, and provides a UI to connect with a back-end.

Blindsend is an open source tool and can be deployed as a SaaS application, or as a stand alone API to be used in external software projects. 

## Installation

To run blindsend, follow the instructions given in the [back-end](https://github.com/blindnet-io/blindsend-be) and [front-end](https://github.com/blindnet-io/blindsend-fe) projects. 

## Development

Blindsend is currently under development by a small team of software engineers and independant cryptography experts. First release to follow soon.
